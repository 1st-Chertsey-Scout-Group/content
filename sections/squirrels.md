Squirrels are young people aged 4 to 6 who:

- Play games and learn new skills
- Have fun and get outdoors
- Make new friends

Every week, they gather in groups to hop, skip and jump their way through lots of different games and activities â€“ achieving anything they set their minds to, and having lots of fun along the way.
