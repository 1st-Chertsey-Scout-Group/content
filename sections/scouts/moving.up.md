**Explorers is our fourth section. It’s for go-getting 14-18 year olds, and it’s all about giving you more freedom to have adventures on your own terms. Scouts move on between the ages of 13½ and 14½, depending on when best suits.**

Being an Explorer will give you the opportunity to spread your wings a little wider and climb a little higher.

Explorer Units are run at a District level, covering wider ground than Scout Troops. As a result, it’s not uncommon for some Explorers to travel a little further to meetings, depending on what’s available in their area.

Your Scout Leader will work with your potential Explorer Leader – and volunteers at District level – to make sure you’re in the know. They’ll move you alongside your friends where possible. And they might organise a few joint events, activities or camps in the build up to the big move, so you can get to know names and faces.

Completing the Moving On Award is a great way to test the waters before you jump ship. You’ll link up with an Explorer Unit for three weeks, and see what you think.

Some things won’t change when you move. Your shirt might change colour, but you’ll still earn badges and awards. And you’ll still run around and get your hands dirty once in a while, because having fun doesn’t stop just because you’re a little older and wiser.

The main thing that will change is the amount of freedom you have. Between the ages of 14 and 18, you’re fast approaching adulthood, and you’ll be treated as such. You’ll make more decisions. You’ll travel. And you’ll conquer the trickiest of expeditions, supported by a trained team of adult volunteers. You’ll also focus harder on the skills that are most valuable and transferrable in life – regardless of if you’re planning to go to university or not. The activities you take part in will give you many opportunities to grab life with both hands, and see where you end up.
