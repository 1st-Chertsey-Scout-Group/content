## The Cub Scout Law

The Promise and Law are at the heart of what we do as Cub Scouts. They express the values we believe in as members of the worldwide family of Scouts.

> Cub Scouts always do their best
> Think of others before themselves
> And do a good turn every day.

## What does the Cub Scout Law mean?

The Law demonstrates the things that we intend to do as Cub Scouts.

- “Do their best”
*A Cub always tries his hardest at whatever they are doing, at school, Cubs, or home.*

- “Think of others before themselves”
*This means thinking about other people and whether they need help rather than being selfish and putting yourself first.*

- “Do a good turn every day”
*Do something nice for someone else every day.*
