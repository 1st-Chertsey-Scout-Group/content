**Moving on to Scouts is a really exciting time, but you might also feel a little sad about saying farewell to some of your fellow Cubs. This is an understandable reaction to change and it’s okay to feel nervous and unsure. Your leader will support you every step of the way.**

In the run up to your last night at Cubs, your Cub leader will talk to your new Scout leader – who you may have already met during joint activities or camps. Together, they’ll do all they can to help make the move as easy as possible for you. Although most Cubs make the move up to Scouts when they’re 10½ , your leader will bear your personal situation in mind, and make sure you only move on when you’re ready. They’ll also have a think about when your friends are moving on, and time things so that you can start your new adventure together where possible.

Talk to your leader about the Moving on Award. Completing it involves spending three weeks with your new Scout section, while keeping up your normal routine at Cubs. During that time, you’ll have the opportunity to see what Scouts is like first-hand – getting to know your new leader, making friends and participating in lots of new and exciting activities. You’ll also get a better understanding of the difference between Cubs and Scouts, and feel more prepared to embrace all of the challenges and adventures the move throws at you.
