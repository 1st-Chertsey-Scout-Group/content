## The Explorer Scout Promise

The Promise and Law are at the heart of what we do as Explorers. They express the values we believe in as members of the worldwide family of Explorers.

> On My Honour, I promise that I will do my best
> To do my duty to God and to the Queen,
> To help other people
> And to keep the Scout Law.

Alternative versions of the promise are available. The core promise, which refers to a ‘Duty to God’, remains intact and Scouting is fully committed as a movement to exploring faith and religion as a core element of its programme. If you would like your child to make a specific promise, please discuss it with the leader.

## The Explorer Scout Motto

> Be Prepared.

## What does the Promise mean?

The Promise is, essentially, a promise that we make to ourselves and to others. It states the values that should all try to act out in our lives and intend, as Baden-Powell said to “leave this world a little better than you found it.”

- “On My Honour“
*This means that this is something that you really mean to keep. You should be sure about what you are promising to do.*

- “I will do my best”
*The commitment to always trying our hardest in whatever we do, to reach the highest standard that we can.*

- “Duty to God”
*To think about what god wants of you, to grow and learn. This applies to any god and all gods.*

- “Duty to the Queen”
*This means that we are showing our respect to our country. As Explorers in the UK, we do our duty to the Queen as she is the Head of State. We do this by saluting the Union Flag at the opening ceremony and obeying the laws. Explorers in other countries pledge to do their duty to their country.*

- “Help other people”
*Working as a team with others; doing things that may not benefit us as individuals.*

- “To keep the Scout Law”
*Speaks for itself!*

## Why do we make the Promise?

We make the Promise to show commitment to Scouting and to the values around which Scouting is based. We make the Promise when we are invested and repeat it at various other times to reaffirm our commitment to Scouting.
