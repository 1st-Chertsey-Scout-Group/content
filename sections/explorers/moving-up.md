**Scout Network is our fifth and final section for 18-25 year olds. Joining is a great way to stay in touch with other young people in Scouts when your time at Explorers comes to an end. Here's what to expect when the time comes.**

When you turn 18, you can become part of Scout Network in the same District you were an Explorer in.

Network members still earn badges digitally, and still go on camps. They still throw themselves into expeditions and aim for their top awards. They still chase adventures overseas and build communities closer to home and get their hands dirty and battle it out for the last of the toasted marshmallows. The main difference is that they have more flexibility and independence and autonomy than any of the other sections. District Scout Networks are self-led, and their programme is designed to fit around the bundle of commitments humans juggle in their late teens and early twenties. You may be less likely to meet weekly, but you’re guaranteed to have just as much fun as you did in Explorers, and to gain even more skills to put on that CV. Because becoming a grown-up shouldn’t mean you have to miss out on all the good stuff.

To get a better idea of what to expect before you take the leap, have a look at our Network Information, and talk to your Explorer Leader about completing the Moving on Award. It involves spending at least three weeks interacting with Scout Network while keeping up your normal routine at Explorers.

Network is flexible and you can choose which District you’d like to be a part of. If you’re moving to start a new job or university course, for example – your District Scout Network Commissioner can help you relocate.

If you’d rather keep things open, though, you don’t have to be affiliated with a specific District. You can opt out locally via Compass, and remain part of the UK Scout Network only. Even British Scouts living abroad can stay involved, as long as their country of residence is a member of British Scouting Overseas.
