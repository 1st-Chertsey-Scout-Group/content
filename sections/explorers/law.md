## The Explorer Scout Law

The Promise and Law are at the heart of what we do as Explorers. They express the values we believe in as members of the worldwide family of Explorers.

> A Scout is to be trusted
> A Scout is loyal
> A Scout is friendly and considerate
> A Scout belongs to the worldwide family of Scouts
> A Scout has courage in all difficulties
> A Scout makes good use of time and is careful of possessions and property
> A Scout has self-respect and respect for others

## What does the Explorer Scout Law mean?

The Law is a list of things that we as Scouts all intend to be.

- “Trusted”
*Do what you say you will; don’t tell lies.*

- “Loyal”
*Sticking by your friends and family, and the side which you have chosen.*

- “Friendly and considerate”
*Be nice to others; think about others before yourself.*

- “Belongs to the worldwide family of Scouts”
*There are millions of Scouts all over the world. We all belong to the Scouting family.*

- “Has courage in all difficulties”
*Never being scared of doing what is right. Always doing our best.*

- “Makes good use of time and is careful of possessions and property”
*By taking care of our possessions and our time, we get the most from them both.*

- “Has self-respect and respect for others”
*By having respect for ourselves, we can earn the respect of others. We must always respect the property and opinions if we want them to respect ours. Respect is important so that we can get along and work together.*

## Why do we keep the Explorer Scout Law?

The Law is a list of important values that we, as Explorers, hold to. If we all hold to the values expressed in the Law, we can make the world a better place to live in.
