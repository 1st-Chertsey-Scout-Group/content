**Between the ages of 5 3/4 and 6, it's usually time for Squirrels to move up to Beavers. Here's what to expect when the time comes.**

Moving on to Beavers is a really exciting time, but you might also feel a little sad about saying farewell to some of your fellow Squirrel Scouts. This is an understandable reaction, and it’s okay to feel nervous and unsure.

In the run up to your last night at Squirrel Scouts, your Squirrel leader will talk to your new Beaver leader – who you may have already met during joint activities. Together, they’ll make the move as easy as possible for you.

Although most Squirrel Scouts move up to Beavers between the ages of 5 3/4 and 6 1/4, leaders can be flexible in cases where a Squirrel Scout may need a bit more time due to additional needs or exceptional circumstances. Generally, they’ll also have a think about when your friends are moving, and time things so that you can start your new adventure together where possible.

To get you extra prepared, your leader might tell you about the Moving on Award. Completing it involves spending at least three weeks with a Beaver section, while keeping up your normal routine at Squirrel Scouts. During that time, you’ll see what Beavers is really like – getting to know your new leaders, making new friends and participating in lots of new and exciting activities. Keep an eye out, as you might even spot some familiar faces from when you first started at Squirrel Scouts!
