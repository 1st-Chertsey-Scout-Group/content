**There is a range of badges and awards available to young people in the Squirrel Scout Section.**

## Activity badges
Many of the badges available are activity badges, which allow Squirrel Scouts to show their progress in existing pursuits, but also to try all kinds of new things and form new interests.

## Challenge badges
Gaining a challenge badge involves accomplishing a number of more ambitious tasks within the Dray or community. There are several challenge badges across a number of themes, from the physical and outdoorsy to challenges dealing with the local community or issues connected with the Scouting world.

## Core badges
In addition, there are a number of core badges, obtained upon joining or moving on from the Dray, or for time spent in the Scouting movement.

## Activity packs
Some activity badges are sponsored by outside companies, and these companies often provide extra exciting resource packs to help Squirrel Scouts towards gaining their badges.
