## The Squirrel Scout Promise

Squirrels make this promise when they are invested into the Squirrel Drey.

> I promise to do my best
> To be kind and helpful
> And to love God

Alternative versions of the promise are available. The core promise, which refers to a â€˜Duty to Godâ€™, remains intact and Scouting is fully committed as a movement to exploring faith and religion as a core element of its programme. If you would like your child to make a specific promise, please discuss it with the leader.
