**The Young Leaders' Scheme is just one of the exciting programme elements in the Explorer Scout section.**

All leaders in the Beaver Scout, Cub Scout and Scout Section who are between the ages of 14 and 18 must be members of an Explorer Scout Young Leaders' Unit. They are Explorer Scouts who choose to devote a large proportion of their time in Scouting to service in another section.
