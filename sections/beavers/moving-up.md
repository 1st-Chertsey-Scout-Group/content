**Between the ages of 7½ and 8½, it's usually time for Beavers to move up to Cubs. Here's what to expect when the time comes.**

Moving on to Cubs is a really exciting time, but you might also feel a little sad about saying farewell to some of your fellow Beavers. This is an understandable reaction to change and it’s okay to feel nervous and unsure.

In the run up to your last night at Beavers, your Beaver leader will talk to your new Cub leader – who you may have already met during joint activities. Together, they’ll make the move as easy as possible for you.

Although most Beavers move up to Cubs at a set age, leaders can be flexible in cases where a Beaver may need a bit more time due to additional needs or exceptional circumstances. Generally, they'll also have a think about when your friends are moving, and time things so that you can start your new adventure together where possible.

To get you extra prepared, your leader might tell you about the Moving on Award. Completing it involves spending at least three weeks with a Cub section, while keeping up your normal routine at Beavers. During that time, you’ll see what Cubs is really like – getting to know your new leaders, making new friends and participating in lots of new and exciting activities. Keep an eye out, as you might even spot some familiar faces from when you first started at Beavers!
