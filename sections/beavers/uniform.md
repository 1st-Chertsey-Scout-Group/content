## What do Beaver Scouts wear?
The Beaver Scout uniform is a blue jumper and a group scarf. There are lots of other optional accessories you can wear such as hats, hoodies, trousers or shorts, if you’d like to.

## Why is uniform important?
Wearing a uniform is comfy and practical. It means you can run around and get messy without ruining your other clothes. It makes you feel part of a team. It means no one feels uncomfortable or left out. And it gives you a place to show off all the brilliant badges you earn.

## Where can I buy it?
Uniform can either be bought from the Scouts online shop or a local supplier. You can ask the leader for more information on what and where to buy.

We don’t want anyone to miss out through financial hardship. If concerns about finances may prevent your child taking part in Scouting or some activities, speak to your local leader, as some assistance may be available in confidence.
