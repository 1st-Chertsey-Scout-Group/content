What don’t Scouts do? At this age, we encourage girls and boys to take responsibility for themselves and each other, with older members leading a small team. They like being with friends and participating fully in the adventure of life. In the Troop Scouts:
  - Develop leadership skills
  - Learn emergency aid
  - Spend nights away – the summer camp is often the highlight of the year
  - Help others in the community
  - Cook, both at home and at camp
  - Adventurous and sporting activities – anything from abseiling to zorbing
  - Learn survival skills
