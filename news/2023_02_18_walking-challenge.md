On the 1st of April 2023, Chertsey Cub Leaders and Young Leaders are off again to do our yearly fundraising challenge.

This year we are going to attempt to walk to every Scout HQ (all 11 of them) in Runnymede… in a single day! The route is 22(ish) miles, so wish us luck!

This year we are raising money for White Lodge Centre: White Lodge provides services and supports lives. They support over 2,500 individuals across Surrey and beyond through a wide and diverse range of services for all ages and abilities.

These fundraising challenges are important to us as a team of leaders as not only do they support amazing causes like White Lodge, but it shows the young people in our group the value of community and charity!

We’ll keep you posted on progress!

Please donate what you can to support our fundraiser /Here’s the link: [Just Giving](https://www.justgiving.com/page/chertseyscoutswalkathonforwhitelodge)
