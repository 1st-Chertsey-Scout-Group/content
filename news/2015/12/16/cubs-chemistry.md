The end of the year went with a bang (quite literally), with the Dons getting a visit from Dr Ann Hubbard and her helpers from the Royal Society of Chemistry.

A fantastic evening conducting scientific experiments with the Kitchen Chemistry Kit that Ann has developed, with Cubs learning about acids, bases, solids, liquids and gases using everyday things that can be found around the house.

The RSC team were impressed with the enthusiasm for the experiments, and thoughtful questions that followed.

Thanks Ann et al. A brilliant evening! :)
