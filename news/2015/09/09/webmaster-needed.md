Are youâ€¦ The One? Could you help the Group improve our online presence? We need help maintaining, updating and developing our website and social media accounts.

If you can spare some time, and put your skills to good use, please contact Toby Athersuch: [chairman@1stchertseyscoutgroup.com](mailto:chairman@1stchertseyscoutgroup.com) or speak to a Leader who can put you in touch. It would not require a major time commitment, but would be much appreciated by the Group, who want to share all the great things we are doing in Scouting.

P.S. Yes, I know The Matrix was released in 1999, but it still cuts it. ;)
