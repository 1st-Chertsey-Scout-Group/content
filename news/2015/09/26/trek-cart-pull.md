Success! An epic effort by 1st Chertsey â€“ Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, Leaders, parents and friends! 26.2 miles of trek cart pulling challenge completed!

Thanks to the Mayor of Runnymede, Councillor Derek Cotty who started the proceedings, and got involved pulling the cart himself.

Together, we rose to the challenge, had fun, raised money for the HQ fund. A brilliant effort.

Watch out for the write-up in the Surrey Advertiser, coming soon (link will be here once published).
