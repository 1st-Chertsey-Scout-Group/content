Alison Gibbons (Abbey Beavers) is a hot shot when it come to archery. She helps run archery events for the Runnymede District Scouts, and also competes at a high level in the UK.

To arrange a session, email Alison and the gang, indicating preferred dates and how many people will be attending/participating. Sessions of up to 12 children at one time can be accommodated (most groups split their groups in half and do a different session on the same week for the other group). Equipment is provided. The sessions canâ€™t be held at the 1st Chertsey HQ because of the central pillar that is in the way, so typically the sessions are held at 1st/4th Addlestone HQ. Other locations are possible, providing they comply with relevant safety/activity regulations and POR.

For more info, section leaders should make contact with Alison and the archery team directly: [archery@runnymedescouts.org.uk](mailto:archery@runnymedescouts.org.uk)
