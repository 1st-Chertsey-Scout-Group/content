Sunday 19th April 2015.
10:00 am
First car park after height barrier/marina.
Gloves, bags and litter picking equipment will be provided. Please wear appropriate footwear and clothing (and Scout Activity gear / scarf). Bring refreshments.

Everyone at 1st Chertsey Scout Group (Beavers / Cubs / Scouts / Parents / Leaders / Committee – Yes EVERYONE) is encouraged to support this.

Part of Chertsey Meads was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1975, and English Nature indicated it was:

‘the only remaining Thames flood meadow of botanical importance’.

In addition to it being a tranquil meadow, the Group use Chertsey Meads for a range of outdoor activities, and it plays host to the Chertsey Agricultural Association Show each year. So let’s go and pick up some of the litter, and keep it nice for us to enjoy and wildlife to live in!

Note: Beavers / Cubs / Scouts
This is a perfect opportunity to work towards some badge requirements while having fun and helping improve the local environment for everyone. Please ensure you are accompanied by a Leader or your parents if you are helping.
