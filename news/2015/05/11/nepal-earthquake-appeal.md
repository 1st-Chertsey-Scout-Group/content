1st Chertsey Scout Group teamed up with Rotary Club of Chertsey for the Nepal Earthquake Appeal.

Over the weekend, over £1000 was donated by generous members of the public in Chertsey Sainsbury’s Shopping Centre, and Wyevale Garden Centre.

The funds raised will go towards providing much needed provisions for those in need, primarily through [ShelterBox](http://www.shelterbox.org/news_global.php?id=1354).

Thanks to all who donated – all your money is going to do good!
