A few pictures from this evening’s fireworks. A huge success. Thanks everyone who helped make it happen, and to everyone who came along to enjoy the show!

Fireworks fanatics were bowled over as the sky over Chertsey Cricket Club was lit up with colourful and dramatic explosions on Saturday night (November 7).

Hundreds of excited people turned up at the ground in Grove Road, with plenty to keep them entertained before the bright and colourful display got under way .

There was music and a tuck shop with sweets, while revellers were also encouraged to take along their own Guy.

The smell of freshly cooked hot food filled the air and there was a licensed bar for the adults.

The evening was raising funds for the 1st Chertsey Scout Group’s appeal for new headquarters and was supported financially by Chertsey county councillor Chris Norman.

The scout group is looking to raise more than £400,000 for its new base in Staines Lane.
