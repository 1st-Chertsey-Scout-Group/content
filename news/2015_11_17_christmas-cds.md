As part of our HQ fundraising, the Group has 2000 copies ready to sell this year – can you help..?

We need the entire Group to come together as our sales force. Could you….
    – Sell CDs at work, to friends, family or neighbours as stocking fillers?
    – Do you run your own business? Why not use the CD as a Christmas present to thank customers, staff or suppliers?
    – Do you have access to any Christmas markets or bazaars?
    – Are there any local retailers or publicans that you are friendly with? Can you help us sell the CD into local shops and pubs?
    – Do you have social media skills? If so, can you help us spread the word?
