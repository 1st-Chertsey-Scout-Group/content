Thank you to all the cubs and leaders who made this year’s cub camp another fantastic success. It has been four years since Dons and Hunters have camped together and it was wonderful fun. The cubs enjoyed Diggerland, Alice Holt Forest, water slides at Guildford Spectrum as well as the Scouting basics of knots, pioneering, backwoods cooking and firelighting. They slept soundly under canvas and we had superb weather throughout the week – luckily the cubs missed Monday’s thunderstorms and monsoon-esque rain!

Our star camper of the week was Stuart, who was a cheery trooper throughout the whole week.

Our star tent included: Ewan, Harvey, Harvey, James, Harry, Hamish and James. These boys kept their tent immaculate and went to bed very well! Well done!

Both the Dons and Hunters cub packs will be meeting again in September for more action-packed fun – keep an eye on the calendar for details of the programmes and key dates such as Sixer and Seconders Camp in late September.

Have a great summer!
 

Lou, Ben, Steve, Katy, Kate, Nick, Molly, Phil, Tom, Rhino, Daisy & Gary the Grasshopper!
