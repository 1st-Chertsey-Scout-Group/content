Green Watch at Chertsey Fire Station kindly hosted an hour of learning and fun for Bourne Beavers. After learning all about [Surrey Fire and Rescue](https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/people-and-community/surrey-fire-and-rescue), and what to do in an emergency, Bourne Beavers were given a tour of a fire engine, including climbing aboard, and were then let loose with the fire hoses and a lot of water!! What fun!! Thank you, Green Watch!
