A busy night at Abbey Beavers, with no less than five new recruits in the Colony! Welcome Beavers!

Following the investiture ceremony and some traditional tail-slapping (for the uninitiated, this means clapping and banging the floor like crazy!), Abbey set about some cake making to raise money for Children in Need – the total for the evening was an impressive £60.76! That’s a lot of cakes, folks! Well done everyone – a generous thing to do to help others.
