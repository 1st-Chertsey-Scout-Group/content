Chertsey Scout Group Cubs and Scouts will be joining Addlestone at their annual **Remembrance Day Parade** on **Sunday 9th November 2014**.

Please ensure your son / daughter is wearing full uniform, and looking smart for the parade. This parade (one of only two every year) is an important part of the Group activities, and all Scouts and Cubs are expected to attend. This year marks the 100th Anniversary of the outbreak of World War One, and we set aside this time to remember all those who have given their lives for the peace and freedom we enjoy today.

Please meet at the Garfield Road car park at 9am (car park next to Addlestone Community Centre). At 9:15am, the parade will set off, ending at Victory Park War Memorial, where a wreath-laying ceremony will take place. The parade will then continue on to church service at St Paulâ€™s Church at 10.30am. You should be able to collect your son / daughter at approximately 11.15am at the conclusion of the service.
