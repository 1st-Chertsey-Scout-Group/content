We were all very pleased to hear that Woking Crematorium had nominated 1st Chertsey as a recipient of their annual charitable collection – £500!

The funds are collected at during the year, including at the Christmas Nativity and via a collection box, and distributed to local community projects and charities. Katy and Steve Valiant met up with Valerie Dunster from the Crematorium this week to say thanks on behalf of the whole Group.
