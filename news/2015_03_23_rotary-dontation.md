The Rotary Club of Chertsey have made a generous donation of Â£1100 to the 1st Chertsey Scout Group HQ Fund.

The money was raised by a recent Ska Souls gig, held at Thorpe Park, with proceeds going to local charities. The Group are obviously delighted with the donation, and wish to convey their gratitude to Ska Souls and the Rotary for their continued support of Scouting in and around Chertsey. Gary Weber, President of Chertsey Rotary Club, presented the funds to GSL Dave Moore on 17th March.
