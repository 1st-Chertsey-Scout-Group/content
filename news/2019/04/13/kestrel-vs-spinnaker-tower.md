Due to initial safety concerns about high winds Katy Valiant (Kestrel; Abbey Beavers) eventually took on her abseil challenge of the epic Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth on 13th April 2019.

Katy said that the 100m drop was a really exciting experience, and hoped it helped raise awareness and much-needed funds for the HQ Project.

Any further support for Katy can be made here – all money will go towards the new build!
