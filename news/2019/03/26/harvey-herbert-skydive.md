The sky is the limit! The very brave Harvey Herbert has decided to hurl himself out of an aircraft as a fundraiser for the new Chertsey Scout Group HQ. With a parachute attached, FYI!

Show your support for this total legend here:

Harvey has been a valuable member of the Group for many years, and though this would be a memorable way to raise funds! You bet it will!

Skydive will take place on 25th August 2018, so get your donations in ASAP.
