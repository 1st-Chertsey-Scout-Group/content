**Volunteers Urgently Needed!!!**

Chertsey Agricultural Show is took place on the weekend of the 10th / 11th August at Chertsey Meads, Mead Lane, Chertsey.

🎉🐴🐄🐖🐔🐍🐝🍅🥒🏅🎪🚗

By far our biggest fundraising event of the year, it was particularly important this year, given the HQ Project that is underway.

It is also the most labour-intensive event – as ever, we manned two car parks, staffed two entrance gates both days, and ran a fairly large catering marquee. 🍔

Many thanks to all those who helped out, contributed cakes, and to everyone who visited our marquee over the weekend. :)
