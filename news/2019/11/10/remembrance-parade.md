A clear and crisp morning greeted members of 1st Chertsey Scout Group today, who joined other community groups in The Act of Remembrance.

Thanks to the local police for their efficient management of the road closures that allowed the parade from Victory Park to St Paulâ€™s church to take place without incident.

We will remember them.
