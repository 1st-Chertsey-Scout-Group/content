Message from the GSL:

As from the 1st April 2015 Group Subscription will be increasing by £1 to £10 per month. The last subscription increase was 2 years ago. As I am sure you will agree Scouting is still very good value for money compared with many other clubs and activities.

For those paying by standing order could you please make the necessary changes with your bank before April subs are due out of your accounts to avoid having to be chased for outstanding subs.

Best,

David Moore
Group Scout Leader
1st Chertsey Scout Group
