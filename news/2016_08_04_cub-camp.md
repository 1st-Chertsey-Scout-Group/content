**Native American Camp 2016!**
Over 20 Cubs (plus a few rogue Beavers and Scouts) packed their rucksacks and journeyed further into Surrey to Garner’s Field campsite in Surrey for the annual Summer Camp.

The theme for camp this year was “Native American” and we had many exciting activities planned. When the Cubs arrived, they toured the campsite and then worked in tribes (Apache, Chinook and Cherokee) to put up their tents. They then created banners decorated with their spirit animals!

As well as tie-dyeing coloured scarves for their tribes, they built tipis (with a little help from our Scouts and Young Leaders – Rosie, Harvey, Nick and Martin). The girls were brave and spent the night in their own tipi!
The cubs enjoyed firelighting with firesteels and char cloth and cooking their own jacket potatoes and of course marshmallows! They even made Bannock Bread twists to have with jam! We had a mid-week wash at Guildford Spectrum and an epic campfire with lots of singing every night.
Thursday saw us all venture down to the coast. It was typically wet, windy and not sunny at all, but we enjoyed a brisk walk along the seafront, a few games in the arcade, fish and chips and watching the hovercraft come and go!

Our final day saw us axe-throwing (thanks Stuart Chenery for excellent ‘axes’) and creating wonderful cardboard rafts which we raced down the river.
