On Wednesday 29th April, 1st Chertsey Dons joined forces with 1st/4th Addlestone Cubs to raise money for Help for Heroes charity in aid of their Community Challenge badges.

Teams of cubs made and brought various cakes and treats, including honeycomb, peppermint creams, rocky roads and the very popular Oreo truffles. They then invited their families to taste some of their delights!

The cubs did a great job making and selling their wares raising in excess of £150! Well done cubs!
