Everything 1st Chertsey do, they do it for you!

Saturday 9th July saw the Group at the Black Cherry Fair, participating in the parade, and also catering for all those attending the main fairground.

Our float – themed on Robin Hood – won the award for “Best Club or Charity”. Well done all!

Thanks to everyone who helped with the float, the costume (awesome), the parade, the stall, and the clear-up!
