Hi everyone,

Logan and Evelyn have had the honour of been selected to represent the 1st Chertsey Scouts troop at the international World Scouts Jamboree in August 2023.

It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity where we will get to meet 40,000 other teenagers from around the world. We will be able to explore, do really fun activities and meet other people from different nations.

We trying to raise Â£7390 to help fund our trip and all of the training we will need before, weekend camps, excursions, travel, etc. We are both so honoured and excited to represent Chertsey, Addlestone, Surrey, and the UK for the upcoming year.

Thank you for reading our story and considering helping us with our journey, every little helps.

Thanks

Logan and Evelyn
