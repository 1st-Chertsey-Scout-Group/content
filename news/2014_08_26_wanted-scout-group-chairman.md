1st Chertsey Scout Group are looking for a volunteer to take on the role of Group Chairman. The current Chairman – Sue Evans – will stand down due to work commitments; her efforts over the past years have been very much appreciated by all.

This role has a relatively low time commitment but is key to the smooth running of the Group. General details of what the role entails are [provided by the Scout Association (link)](https://www.scouts.org.uk/).

If you are interested in becoming involved – or know someone else who might be, please [contact Dave Moore (Group Scout Leader)]({{websiteUrl}}/contact/) for an informal chat to find out more about the position.

Nominations for the role will next be considered at the [Group AGM on 12th September]({{websiteUrl}}/event/scout-group-agm/) so please get in touch as soon as possible. Lord Kitchener had this to say:
