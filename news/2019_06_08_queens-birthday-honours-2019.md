THE QUEEN has been graciously pleased, on the occasion of the Celebration of Her Majesty’s Birthday, to approve the award of the British Empire Medal (Civil Division) to the undermentioned:

For services to the community in Chertsey, Surrey.

Congratulations, Brian! Very well deserved on account of your tireless work to make things better for everyone. The Group are fortunate to have you assistance, and the HQ Project would not be anywhere near completion without your efforts.
