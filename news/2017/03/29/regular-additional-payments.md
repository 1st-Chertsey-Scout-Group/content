One easy way to directly help the Group is to make an additional voluntary payment each month. Donate are much as you can afford â€“ it all helps!

Payments will go directly to our fundraising efforts that support regular activities and equipment, as well as the new HQ project.

If you prefer to make a cash donation, or would like to arrange another way to make a contribution, please contact a leader who will be able to assist you.
