On 23rd April this year, our sporty Otter (Phil Boast; Beaver Leader – Abbey Colony) is going for a run! Here’s what he has to say about it:

”
It’s a long, long road…

When I was 8 years old I joined 1st Chertsey Cubs who inhabited an old hut that was probably lucky to survive the war… We moved to a church hall for a while then back to our ‘new’ (refurbished factory) hut which was the best in the district for years and has witnessed 1000s of Beavers, Cubs and Scouts benefit from Scouting…

A generation later and my kids joined the same Scout Group and are better people for it. The hut however has had its day. As a local councillor, the last thing my dad Peter achieved for his community before he lost his fight to cancer was to secure planning permission for our new hut and our next chapter as one of the oldest Scout Groups in the world.

We now need to urgently raise funds for which I’m busy training (destroying my knees) to do the London Marathon for! I can’t set a financial target as we need so much but please, if you can support me in my trial feel free to help.

Not long to go, so I will be nagging.

Boasty x

From everyone at 1st Chertsey Scout Group – GOOD LUCK PHIL!!!
