Message from the GSL:

“For those requiring new uniform or replacement uniform (Beaver, Cub & Scout) I have arranged for Andy Sainsbury-Brown to bring the Runnymede Scout shop down to our HQ on Monday 28th September to sell uniform directly for all sections. Between 7pm – 8pm directly after Monday night Beavers.

You will have the opportunity to try on the uniform ensuring you get the correct size first time round. I will also have our group polo shirts on sale for those who want new or replacements, these are priced at £7.50 each.
