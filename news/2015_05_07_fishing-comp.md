**The Results – Cubs District Fishing Competition – Saturday 2nd May**

Well done to all of the Cubs who took part in today’s Fishing Competition.

Weather conditions were good, we had an excellent turn out and thanks to the parents who supervised from the lakes edge. And a very special thanks to Les
Webber the founder of the fishing project lake and his fellow team of fisherman for their help.

So the results are in…..
The winner for the most fish caught is George D – 1st Chertsey Hunters – George not only caught 16 fish but also the demon pike who was terrorising the lake.

The winner for the heaviest total catch is George D – 1st Chertsey Hunters as his 16 fish weighed 4 lbs and that didn’t include demon pike !

The winning team for the total weight of fish caught by pack, is you’ve guessed it 1st Chertsey Hunters, as with the help of Jack G for his 30z catch and Georges 4lb the catch was 4 lbs and 3oz.

We had a last minute entry that was awarded to Alex S from 5th Addlestone for the heaviest individual fish caught which weighed in at 10oz as this hungry perch but on 2lb while in the keep net as he ate the little tiddler that was sharing the net !

Certificates were awarded, Chertsey hunters are proud to display the trophy and George & Ben were awarded from Les a fishing rod each.

Each Cub took home a special angling project pack too that included a copy of the Angling Times ready for their next fishing adventure.
