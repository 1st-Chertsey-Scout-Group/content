1st Cherstey Scout Group were out in force to help with a community cleanup this week. Runnymede Borough Council organised a litter pick at Chertsey Meads on Sunday 19th April, and Beaver, Cubs, Scouts, and Leaders turned out to help. 1st Chertsey Beavers were particularly productive, and found a variety of weird and wonderful items including old tyres and a bicycle!

One of the organisers posted up the following on Streetlife.com:
”
Thank you so much to everyone who came and helped with the litter pick this morning. It was so successful this time that we ran out of litter grabbing tools! Thank you to the young Beavers who cheerfully joined in too.
It is good to know that even though some local residents are content to drop litter we have community minded volunteers willing to clear up after them!
”

I think all those who took part we amazed and somewhat appalled by the volume of rubbish that was collected by volunteers in just a couple of hours.

Thanks to all those who did make the effort – it is brilliant to be helping out around the local community, and keeping Chertsey such a pleasant place to live.
