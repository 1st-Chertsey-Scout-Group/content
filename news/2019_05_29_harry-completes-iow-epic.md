On May 29th 2019, Harry from 1st Chertsey Scout Group set out to ride his bicycle around the **Isle of Wight** in an attempt to complete the 66-mile **IOW Cycle Challenge**.

The route took him around all of so-called Dinosaur Island presenting some wonderful scenery and difficult climbs in equal measure.

Writing from the road, Harry said:

“We did a chalk ridge extreme trail today, which was more difficult than we both thought it would be, as it was an almost vertical climb, ending in fog where we were so high, so we couldn’t actually see where we were going! Was well worth it though, as lovely views when we were coming down!”

Well done Harry for completing your epic adventure on two wheels!

What’s next! ;)
